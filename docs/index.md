### 🎉 What is [**Feijuca.Auth**](https://github.com/coderaw-io/Feijuca.Auth)?
**Feijuca.Auth** is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify integration with Keycloak, providing both a NuGet package and an API to streamline authentication, authorization, access control management and RBAC.

**Feijuca** is a nickname for **Feijoada**. The name was inspired by the iconic Brazilian dish [Feijoada](https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-feijoada-brazils-national-dish), the name reflects our Brazilian roots and cultural heritage.


### 🌟 Key features:

**Feijuca.Auth** offers a range of features for simplifying integration with Keycloak, focusing on efficient management of authentication and authorization:

- **👥 User Management**: 
  - Easily create and remove users and groups.
  - Efficiently handle password resets, email confirmations, and session revocations.


- **🔒 Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Securely verify user identities.
  - Manage user permissions and enforce access policies based on roles using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
