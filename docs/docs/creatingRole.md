### üìù How to Use the Endpoint

1. **Tenant Identification**:
   - The term *tenant* in Feijuca represents the **realm name** within Keycloak where you‚Äôll be performing actions.
   - You must specify the tenant name in the **HTTP header** to proceed.


2. **Body**:
   - After setting up the header, inform a valid body to insert a user. Example:  

	```json
	{  
	  "clientId": "Unique identifier of your customer(Guid)",
      "name": "test",
      "description": "description test"
	}
	
	```
