# About **Feijuca**

The name **Feijuca** is inspired by the iconic Brazilian dish **Feijoada**. Since the creators are from Brazil, we wanted to choose a name that is both fun and culturally relevant. **Feijuca** is a casual nickname for **Feijoada**, and it reflects our connection to Brazilian culture.

## What is **Feijuca**?

- **Feijuca.Auth.Api**: A module that simplifies API management for Keycloak, focusing on user authentication and authorization and RBAC.
