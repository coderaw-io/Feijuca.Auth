### üìù How to Use the Endpoint

1. **Tenant Identification**:
   - The term *tenant* in Feijuca represents the **realm name** within Keycloak where you‚Äôll be performing actions.
   - You must specify the tenant name in the **HTTP header** to proceed.


2. **Body**:
   - After setting up the header, inform a valid body to insert a user. Example:  

	```json
	{  
	  "username": "teste@teste.com",
      "password": "teste12345",
      "revokeActiveSessions": true
	}
	
	```
