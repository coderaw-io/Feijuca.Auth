### üìù How to Use the Endpoint

1. **Tenant Identification**:

   - The term _tenant_ in Feijuca represents the **realm name** within Keycloak where you‚Äôll be performing actions.
   - You must specify the tenant name in the **HTTP header** to proceed.

2. **Body**:

   - After setting up the header, inform a valid body to insert a user. Example:

   ```json
   {
     "userId": "Unique user identifier",
     "groupId": "Unique group identifier"
   }
   ```
