## What is **Feijuca.Auth**?

Inspired by the iconic Brazilian dish [Feijoada](https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-feijoada-brazils-national-dish), the name **Feijuca** reflects our Brazilian roots and cultural heritage. **Feijuca** is a playful nickname for **Feijoada**, embodying the spirit of our project: a fusion of functionality and culture.

**Feijuca.Auth** is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify integration with Keycloak, providing both a NuGet package and an API to streamline authentication, authorization, and access control management.

### Key Features:

**Feijuca.Auth** provides a comprehensive solution for simplifying integration with Keycloak, focusing on efficient management of authentication and authorization. Key features include:

- **User Management**: 
  - Easily create and remove user and groups.
  - Easily user handling passoword reset, email confirmation and session revoke
  
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Securely verify user identities.
  - Efficiently manage user permissions and enforce access policies based on roles using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

- **Multi-Tenant Support**: 
  - Integrate with Keycloak in a multi-tenant model, where each realm acts as a separate tenant within your application, enabling scalable and secure management of authentication and authorization across multiple tenants.

Together, these components of **Feijuca.Auth** aim to reduce the complexity of working with Keycloak, making user management and multi-tenancy more seamless and developer-friendly.
