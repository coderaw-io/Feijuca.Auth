### üìù How to Use the Endpoint

1. **Tenant Identification**:
   - The term *tenant* in Feijuca represents the **realm name** within Keycloak where you‚Äôll be performing actions.
   - You must specify the tenant name in the **HTTP header** to proceed.


2. **Body**:
   - After setting up the header, inform a valid body to insert a user. Example:  

	```json
	{  
	    "name": "Name of group",
        "attributes": {
        "additionalProp1": [
          "test1"
        ],
        "additionalProp2": [
          "test2"
        ],
        "additionalProp3": [
          "test3"
        ]
      }
	}
	
	```

The attributes property is not mandatory, but if you wanna configure some attribute to your group, you can defined it using this field.
An example about how attribute works, could be found below:

The JSON used to created this attribute was:

```json
"attributes": {
    "additionalProp1": [
      "test1"
    ],
    "additionalProp2": [
      "test2"
    ],
    "additionalProp3": [
      "test3"
    ]
  }
}
```
