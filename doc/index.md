## Why Feijuca? ðŸ«˜
Feijuca is a nickname for a famous Brazilian dish called [Feijoada](https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-feijoada-brazils-national-dish). I wanted to use a name representing my country on this project, and Feijuca was chosen.

## **About the project: ðŸ§¾**
This repository aims to provide a configuration option for .NET projects that are using or planning to use Keycloak for authentication and authorization. The project consists of two distinct parts:
1. **Feijuca.Keycloak.Auth.MultiTenancy**
2. **Feijuca.Keycloak.TokenManager**
