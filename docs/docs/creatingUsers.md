### üìù How to Use the Endpoint

1. **Tenant Identification**:
   - The term *tenant* in Feijuca represents the **realm name** within Keycloak where you‚Äôll be performing actions.
   - You must specify the tenant name in the **HTTP header** to proceed.


2. **Body**:
   - After setting up the header, inform a valid body to insert a user. Example:  

	```json
	{  
	  "username": "test",
	  "password": "123456",
	  "email": "test@test.com",
	  "firstName": "Test Firstname",
	  "lastName": "Test Lastname",
	  "attributes": {
		"tenant": [
			"smartconsig"
			]
		}
	}
	
	```

An example about how attribute works, could be found below:

![Attributes definition](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbyrluup1/image/upload/e2l4wkakcb1rgrwcxrfp.jpg "Attributes definition")   

The JSON used to created this attribute was:

```json
"attributes": {
    "tenant": [
      "smartconsig"
    ]
  }
}
```
