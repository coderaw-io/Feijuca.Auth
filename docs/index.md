## What is **Feijuca.Auth**?

First of all, the name **Feijuca** is inspired by the iconic Brazilian dish **Feijoada**. Since the creators are from Brazil, we wanted a name that is both fun and culturally relevant. **Feijuca** is a casual nickname for **Feijoada**, reflecting our connection to Brazilian culture.

**Feijuca** is a project designed to simplify the integration with Keycloak. It offers two main modules:

### **Feijuca.Auth**

This NuGet package provides essential classes for configuring and managing the Feijuca.Auth project. It plays a key role in enabling project-specific settings and ensures smooth functionality.

With this package, you can:

- Configure and validate user permissions, ensuring users have the correct roles.
- Handle JWT token validation, ensuring the token is legitimate and issued by a trusted authority.
- Integrate Keycloak in a multi-tenant model, where each realm in Keycloak serves as a tenant within your application.

This makes it an efficient solution for managing authentication and authorization across multiple tenants in a scalable and secure way.

### **Feijuca.Auth.Api**

A module that simplifies API management for Keycloak, focusing on user authentication, authorization, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

With these modules, **Feijuca** aims to reduce the complexity of working with Keycloak, making user management and multi-tenancy more seamless and developer-friendly.
