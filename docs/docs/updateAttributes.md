### üìù How to Use the Endpoint

1. **Tenant Identification**:

   - The term _tenant_ in Feijuca represents the **realm name** within Keycloak where you‚Äôll be performing actions.
   - You must specify the tenant name in the **HTTP header** to proceed.

2. **Query Parameter**:

   - Provide the `id` of the user in the query string to specify the user to update.

3. **Body**:

   - After setting up the header and query parameter, provide a valid body to update the user attributes. Example:

   ```json
   {
     "username": "updatedTest",
     "email": "updated@test.com",
     "firstName": "Updated Firstname",
     "lastName": "Updated Lastname",
     "attributes": {
       "updated-attribute": ["new-value"]
     }
   }
   ```
