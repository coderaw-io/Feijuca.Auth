### Prerequisites üìã
This project was made with the purpose to attend only applications that follows the current [.Net Supported versions.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) 

## Why Feijuca ü´ò?
Feijuca is a nickname for a famous Brazilian dish called [Feijoada](https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-feijoada-brazils-national-dish). I wanted to use a name representing my country on this project and Feijuca was chosen.

## **About the projectüßæ**
This repository aims to provide a configuration option for .NET projects that are using or planning to use Keycloak for authentication and JWT token generation. The project consists of two distinct parts:
1. **Feijuca.Keycloak.Auth.MultiTenancy**
2. **Feijuca.Keycloak.TokenManager**

**Attention: ü´µ** 
- The projects work in isolation way, there is no dependency between them. You do not need use one to use other, note that each project has different purpose, below you can understand better:

## Feijuca.Keycloak.Auth.MultiTenancy üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
A [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Feijuca.Keycloak.MultiTenancy) package that enables the implementation of multi-tenancy concepts using Keycloak. With this package, each realm acts as a different tenant, allowing for unique configurations for each one. This ensures that each tenant within your application can have its own settings and configurations within Keycloak.

### Features ‚õ≤
- You can use all existings keycloak features following a multi tenancy concept based on your realms, so you can handle different configurations based on each tenant (realm).
- With just one instance from your application you can handle different tenants using the same JWT token generation config
- Obtaining information such as a tenant, user id, url and so on from a token. (If you wanna implement a method do retrieve another thing related to the token, open a PR)

## Getting Started on Feijuca.Keycloak.Auth.MultiTenancy

- Prerequisites
     It is assumed that you already have your Keycloak instance configured, including the creation of clients with their respective settings (scopes, etc.).
  
- Keycloak configuration steps:        
   - 1. **Configuring audience**:
        Create a new audience related to the scopes used your client and include the audience on your client:
        ![image](https://github.com/fmattioli/Feijuca.Keycloak.AuthServices/assets/27566574/6b7b437e-fa29-4776-b29f-4dba8e6d1f21)
        **This step is important and mandatory because on each request received the tool will confirm the token audience**

- Your project configurations steps:
   - 2. Appsettings.json
        Filled out appsettings file on your application, relate all of yours realms (tenants)
      ```sh
      {
         "AuthSettings": {
            "Realms": [
               {
                  "Name": "yourTenantName1",
                  "Audience": "your-audience-defined-on-step1",
                  "Issuer": "https://url-keycloakt/realms/yourTenantName1"
               },
               {
                  "Name": "yourTenantName2",
                  "Audience": "your-audience-defined,
                  "Issuer": "https://url-keycloakt/realms/yourTenantName2"
               },
               {
                  "Name": "yourTenantName3",
                  "Audience": "your-audience-defined",
                  "Issuer": "https://url-keycloakt/realms/yourTenantName3"
               }
         ],
         "ClientId": "your-client-id",
         "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret",
         "AuthServerUrl": "https://url-keycloak"
         }
      }
      ```

- 3. Configure dependency
      Map appsettings configurations values (Note that AuthSettings is a model defined on **Feijuca.Keycloak.Auth.MultiTenancy**, I recommend you use the GetSection method to map the appsettings configs to the AuthSettings model:
      ```sh
      var settings = configuration.GetSection("AuthSettings").Get<AuthSettings>();
      ```
   
     Add the service to the service collection from your application, I recommend you create a new extension method as below:
  
      ```sh   
      builder.Services
       .AddApiAuthentication(applicationSettings.AuthSettings!);
      
      public static class AuthExtension
       {
           public static IServiceCollection AddApiAuthentication(this IServiceCollection services, AuthSettings authSettings)
           {
               services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
               services.AddSingleton<JwtSecurityTokenHandler>();
               services.AddKeyCloakAuth(authSettings!);
   
               return services;
           }
       }
      ```
- 4. Conclusion:
   Following a default example, after generated, your token should have the following details:
   Audience(s) related to the clients scopes:
   
    ![image](https://github.com/fmattioli/Feijuca.Keycloak.AuthServices/assets/27566574/18da7c8b-81f7-4bd7-b794-8eb768db9d18)
   
   And your appsettings should be:
   ```sh   
   "AuthSettings": {
      "Realms": [
        {
          "Name": "10000",
          "Audience": "receipts-commandhander-api",
          "Issuer": "https://url-keycloak/realms/10000"
        }
      ],
      "ClientId": "receipts-commandhander-api",
      "Resource": "receipts-commandhander-api",
      "AuthServerUrl": "https://url-keycloak",      
    }
   ```
   With this configuration you should be able to use Keycloak following a multi tenancy contenxt using .NET.
   Following this [link](https://github.com/fmattioli/Feijuca.Keycloak.AuthServices/blob/main/src/Feijuca.Keycloak.Auth.MultiTenancy/Feijuca.Keycloak.MultiTenancy/Extensions/AuthExtensions.cs) you can understand what is the logic used to validate the token received.
  
## Feijuca.Keycloak.TokenManager üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
Managing certain actions in the Keycloak API can be complicated. For example, creating a new user involves several steps: obtaining a token, creating the user, setting attributes, and setting a password. Feijuca.Keycloak.TokenManager aims to simplify these processes and abstract the complexity related to Keycloak API calls.

**Feijuca.Keycloak.TokenManager** is an API that abstracts, facilitates and simplifies calls to perform actions in Keycloak.
Over time, the goal is to encapsulate multiple Keycloak endpoints, making it easier to perform actions that would be more complex using just the Keycloak API.

### Features ‚õ≤
- Every action in one place. Forget about call multiples endpoints to do actions about users on keycloak. Do actions related to the user (Creation, remotion, e-mail confirming, password redefinition, and so on) based on predefined endpoints.
- Custom endpoints based on your necessities (If you think it could be helpful to the project, open a PR to discuss additional features).

 
## Getting Started - Using Token Manager Api
- Keycloak configuration steps:
     - 1. **Giving permissions to the realm:**
        To be possible manage users using the Keycloak Api, it is necessary to provide some permissions on your keycloak client.  You can handle it on an existing realm, or you can create a new realm. 
        You can follow this [link](https://steve-mu.medium.com/create-new-user-in-keycloak-with-admin-restful-api-e6e868b836b4) to understand how provide these permissions.
