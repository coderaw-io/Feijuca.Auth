### 💡 Considerations

This project is specifically designed for applications that adhere to the current **.NET supported versions**. However, the **Feijuca.Auth.Api** module can be accessed from any programming language, as it processes calls against **Keycloak**.

If you intend to use only the API module (for creating users, managing groups, sessions, and tokens), you can do so without having **.NET** in your technology stack, as it is a RESTful API. 

On the other hand, if your stack is built with **.NET**, you'll benefit from enhanced capabilities and integration options. As you progress through the documentation, you'll gain a better understanding of these advantages.
